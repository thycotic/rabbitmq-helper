# RabbitMq Helper

The RabbitMQ Helper is a tool whose purpose is to assist with installing [RabbitMq](https://www.rabbitmq.com)

RabbitMq is not a Thycotic product and we do not receive revenue for it. We built the RabbitMq Helper to help our customers more easily install RabbitMq (RabbitMq is an important component of Secret Serverâ€™s on-premises environment).

## What can the helper do for me?

*The RabbitMq Helper currently, and for the forseeable future, only works on Windows OS.*

- Online and Offline Install RabbitMq with or without TLS
- Convert certificates for use with RabbitMq
- Establish RabbitMq clusters and streamline cluster policies
- Establish RabbitMq federations and streamline federation policies
- Enable management UI
- Create basic users
- View/manage the RabbitMq log
