# RabbitMQ and RabbitMQ Helper

RabbitMQ is an important component of Secret Serverâ€™s on-premises environment, providing a robust framework for queuing messages between Secret Server and its Distributed Engines. RabbitMQ is an enterprise-ready software package that provides reliability and clustering functionality superior to other applications. For detailed information about RabbitMQ go to https://www.rabbitmq.com/. RabbitMQ is not a Thycotic product and we receive do revenue from it. We provide direct support for versions of RabbitMQ/Erlang only when they are installed through the Thycotic Rabbit MQ Helper in Windows.
